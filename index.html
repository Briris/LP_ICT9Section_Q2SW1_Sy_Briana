		<td>Chongyun - Genshin Impact</td>
		<td>An exorcist who roams the land with Liyue as his base of operations, evil spirits fleeing wherever he goes. <br>As the heir to a clan of exorcists, he has always possessed abilities superior to most. However, these abilities are not the result of training, but of an inborn trait — a pure yang spirit.</td>
